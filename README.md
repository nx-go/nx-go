> [!NOTE]
> This README refers to v3 of the plugin, currently in **beta**. We look forward to your feedback in [#107](https://github.com/nx-go/nx-go/issues/107). If you use **Nx < 17**, [look here](https://github.com/nx-go/nx-go/tree/v2.8.0#readme).

## âœ¨ Features

- Generate Go applications and libraries **in seconds** within your Nx workspace
- Execute, build, format and test projects with a customizable configuration
- Efficient caching and dependency graph tools for Go projects
- Use official Go commands in the background

## ðŸš€ Getting started

You need to have a [stable version of Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed on your machine. And.. you are ready!

### During the beta phase

As the plugin is still in beta, it is impossible to use the quick commands for workspace creation or addition via Nx.
You need to install the plugin manually and initialize it in your workspace. If you don't have one, follow the [official documentation](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation) to create one.

```shell
npm install -D @nx-go/nx-go@beta
nx g @nx-go/nx-go:init
```

### Migrate to beta version

```shell
nx migrate @nx-go/nx-go@beta
```

### Don't want to use a multi-module Go workspace?

The plugin configures a [multi-module Go workspace](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces) by default, to simplify project management and improve the quality of the Nx graph. If you don't want to take advantage of this feature, you can use generator `convert-to-one-mod` after the plugin installation. Generators will automatically adapt to your configuration.

```shell
nx g @nx-go/nx-go:convert-to-one-mod
```

## ðŸ“– Generators & executors

### Generators

- `application`: [Generate a Go application](./docs/generators/application.md)
- `library`: [Generate a Go library](./docs/generators/library.md)

### Executors

- `build`: [Build a Go project](./docs/executors/build.md)
- `lint`: [Format and lint a Go project](./docs/executors/lint.md)
- `serve`: [Run a Go application](./docs/executors/serve.md)
- `test`: [Run tests of a Go project](./docs/executors/test.md)

> [!TIP]
> You can use `nx list @nx-go/nx-go` to see list capabilities.

Want to try out these capabilities quickly? Visit our [playground](https://github.com/nx-go/nx-go-playground)!

## ðŸ§© Compatibility

| nx-go version | Nx version   |
|---------------|--------------|
| 3.x           | 17.x, 18.x   |
| 2.x           | 13.x to 16.x |
| 1.x           | < 13.x       |

This plugin is only tested on [stable versions of Go](https://go.dev/dl/), older versions does not receive support. However, you can expect a fair degree of compatibility. Please note that multi-module Go workspaces require Go 1.18 or later.
